<li>Hi! My name is Michaela and I am a senior majoring in English.</li> <br>

<li>I decided to take this class becuase I have a background in graphic design, and I am going into user experience design as a career when I graduate. I thought learning to code would make me a more well rounded UX designer.</li><br>

<li> I have every limited experience in the form of an online crash course I took 8 months ago and haven't looked at since.</li><br>

<li> I want to be able to come away with enough coding skills that I feel like I am not lying when I put on my resume that I can code.</li><br>

<li> From my UX experience I know that I eye travels differently on the screeen than on paper. This behavior has to be taken into account in order to make sure the user does not fatigue when looking at the screen.</li><br>

<li><a href="https:http://time.com/">Time Magazine's website</a> has a very effective layout design. Trending articles and main stories are displayed larger to the viewer while less popular articles and older articles are displayed smaller on the right-hand side of the site.</li><br>

<li><a href="hhtp://reddit.com">Reddit</a> is very good at visually communicating an information heirarchy. Even though it's not pretty, it works.</li><br>

<li><a href="https://www.hvnlabel.com/">HVN's website</a> is very simplistically set up, fun and colorful. The navigation is easy to spot, and it is aesthetically pleasing. Plus, it's my favorite brand eventhough it's ridiculously expensive, so I only window shop. A girl can dream, right?</li>
