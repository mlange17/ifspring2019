	<h1>Louisa's FeedBack For My Wireframe</h1>
	<h2>An Epic for the Digital Age</h2><br>
	<p> After I switched over my wireframe from desktp to mobile,Lousia told me to make my the text of my headings bigger so that the user could read it more easily and to possibly make my photos smaller.</p>
	<p>I realize this isn't a lot of feedback but I made a very low-fi wireframe on Sketch so this is about as much as she could have said. :) </p>

	<p> I think she is right, and I am going to play around with the flow of photo sizes and text sizes in an InVision prototype. </p>
