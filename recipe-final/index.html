	        <h3>History of Tres Leches</h3>
	        <p class="historyofcake">While there is dispute, tres leches is thought to have originated from native Nicaragua by most historians. This cake is very popular in Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean. </p><p class="historyofcake">This recipe is believed to have come from a Latin American company that put it on the back of their condensed milk and evaporated milk cans to promote their uses. Condensed milk and evaporated milk first came into use in the mid to late 1800s as a way to preserve milk without refrigeration. Both became immediate successes in urban areas where fresh milk was difficult to keep. </p><p class="historyofcake">Out of this success, the tres leches cake became popular. Today, the use of condensed and evaporated milk is a part of Latin American culture, and tres leches is enjoyed by all, regardless of occasion.</p>
