<h2>Feedback for Patrick</h2>

<ul>
<li>So obviously James talked to you about differentiating your quotes, just repeating it to remind you!</li>
<li>your font in the first two mobile design looks disproportional to the image, a little big, I would make it a smaller font and possibly bolder</li>
<li>in the second iteration desktop, the light in the back makes the words hard to see, maybe add the gradient thing James mentioned?</li>
<li>unsure if I think the way the photo is cropped for the second iteration mobile works or not… like I get what you’re doing, but if it’s a quote about cars, shouldn’t we see the full car?</li>
<li>for the third iteration desktop, car too small, font to big, also spacing is a little off. Idk I just think this layout could be displayed a lot more pleasingly to the eye</li>
<li>I like the third iteration mobile :)</li>
