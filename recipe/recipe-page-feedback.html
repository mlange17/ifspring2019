		<h2>From Susannah:</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>The history is cumbersome to read on mobile, maybe try to shorten the history and make the text box wider so its more comfortable. Also left justified is easier to read for paragraphs</li>
				<li>Good hierarchy with text, I like the check boxes</li>
				<li>The ingredient list is aligned differently than everything below it</li>
				<li>Some spelling errors (forsting instead of frosting)</li>
				<li>Very clear and easy to read</li>
				<li>The large image of the dish is wider than the screen size</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>From Michaela:</h2>
		<p>I definitely agree with both peer critiques. I definitely needed to look up the content on my phone in order to understand how spacing and sizing comes into play. I will definitely look at both notes and adjust accordingly and will constantly sure things look okay on my cellphone. </p>
